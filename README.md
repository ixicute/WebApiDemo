# WebApiDemo

## A Demo code
This code showcases how to make an api with two end-points (A Get and a Post).

- [ ]  It has a simple entity framework setup of Employee and Role.
- [ ]  It shows how a repository pattern works with DTOs

## To use it:
- [ ]  Start by editing the connection string in the appsettings.json.
Simply add the server-name that you have.

- [ ]  in the PM-console type "update-database".
You won't need to use "add-migration" as there already is a migration file.
